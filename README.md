# art-trainer
This art trainer provides an environment for aspiring artist to train themselves by using randomly generated prompts.

# Version 1: Shapes and Texture
In this version, the generator will focus on shapes and texture (material). 

Features:
- Users can expect a random combination of shapes and texture as a prompt to try on their own.
- The user can set a timer limit to timebox their practice. (The default timer is set to 3 minutes)
- The users can set their preference in what shapes/textures they wish to expect


# Version 2: Randomize uploaded images
Version 2 extends version 1 to include another functionality to allow users to upload multiple images to use as the random prompts. 

Features:
- The ai-trainer would randomly prompt from the uploaded images and the user (artist) can practice drawing that image. 
- The user can use the timer feature to timebox them and when they are done
- the user can choose to generate next prompt or add more photos, or end.
